# That sure looks like a horse!

## Project Overview
I created an image classification application using a deep neural network with convolutions. This application trains a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It then uses the trained model to classify new images.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Tensorflow and neural networks
- Model validation and evaluation

## Objective
To create a model that classifies images as horses or humans with high accuracy
